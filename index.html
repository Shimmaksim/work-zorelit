      <p class="head__subtitle">
        BrainVu uses a non-invasive and remote mobile/AR/VR camera to extract
        physiological bio-markers that indicate changes in brain activities and
        extract human emotional responses including: Mental Load, Stress Level
        and Emotional Engagement. Using these responses BrainVu can connect to a
        multitude of platforms and provide emotional and mental representation
        for those responses.

              sensory and emotional experiences (such as taste, video and more)
              BrainVu uses a set of questions and responses measured by the

              By combining the indices developed together with additional bio

              BrainVu has created the BrainVu Sentiment Index. It gauges both
              tendency towards a specific products/touch points as well as the
              emotional engagement (stress excitement, mental load) of the
              consumer during the research experience.
